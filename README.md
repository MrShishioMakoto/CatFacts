Cat Facts App

Cat Facts is an iOS prototype that brings a curated collection of cat trivia to enthusiasts everywhere. 
The app features a scrollable list of facts fetched from a public API, complete with intuitive search and filtering. 
Verified entries display a dedicated icon, and newly created facts are labeled with a “new” badge. 
Developed with Swift, UIKit, MVVM, Combine, TDD, and SOLID principles, Cat Facts ensures a robust, testable architecture and a clean, scalable codebase for a seamless user experience.
